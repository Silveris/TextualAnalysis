## TextualAnalysis
This is my first big jump into multi step web-based data analysis. this is meant to be a learning experience and a way to show off what I know how to do and how far I've come in my programming journey.

## Summary
The goal was to take a user entered song and scrape the lyrics off of the internet. the program would then break down the song into word counts and return a csv of the different words and their values. graphing and comparisons between songs were intended as well. The end result would be displayed on a webpage.

## Motivation
This was brought about by a discussion about what the most generic song from each genre would sound like and what the lyrics would be. it then evolved into what makes the top songs standout in terms of lyrical comp. 

## Build status
incomplete. project suspended to work on a paid project.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- requests
- BS4
- pandas
- flask
- mongo DB

## How to use?
the scraper works but that’s as far as it gets for now

#### Anything else that seems useful
I plan to return to this if someone is interested in it.
